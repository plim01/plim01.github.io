                    <h1>Brief History</h1>
                    <p>According to scientists, French Polynesia was one of
the last areas to be settled by humans. It is no known why and from where
Polynesians migrated from. The first Polynesian contact with Europeans was
in 1521 when Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer, discovered the
islands. During the age of European colonization, the islands passed
through the control of several European powers such as Spain and England.
<br></p>

                    <p>Currently, French Polynesia is a collectivity of 118
south Pacific islands (67 of which are inhabited by about 300,000 people)
of the Republic of France. These islands are divided into five following
archipelagos:</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Society Islands</li>
                            <li>Tuamotu Archipelago</li>
                            <li>Gambier Archipelago</li>
                            <li>Marquesas Islands</li>
                            <li>Austral Islands</li>
                        </ol>

                    <p>The Society Island group is contains the most
populous and well known of the French Polynesian islands such as Tahiti,
which contains Pape'ete, the capital of the collectivity, and Bora Bora, a
popular tourist destination. French Polynesia became an overseas territory
of France since 2003, after being an overseas territory since 1957 and a
protectorate since 1842. These islands span over 1000 miles and the land
area of all islands combines is slightly larger than that of Long
Island.</p>

                    <h1>Culture</h1>
                    <p>French Polynesia is inhabited by various ethnically
Polynesian ethnic groups. However, there is a population of minority
ethnically mixed Polynesians, Europeans (mostly French) and East Asians
(mostly Chinese). The official language of French Polynesia is France, but
traditional Polynesian languages such as Tahitian are widely used. <br></p>

                    <p>The islands are mainly Christian as a result of
Christian European missionaries during the age of exploration. However, the
islands still contain remnants of ancient religion. The ruins of marae
(open-air places of worship) are scattered across French Polynesia.  These
sites were used to celebrate family events and to hold village meetings,
sacrifices, and religious rituals. <br></p>

                    <p>The French Polynesian holiday calendar reflects the
influence of various cultures in French Polynesia. The islands celebrate
many French public holidays (e.g. New Year's, V-E Day, Bastille Day,
Armistice Day), many Christian holidays (Easter, Christmas, All Saints')
and many traditional holidays such as the Heiva festival and Hawaiki Nui
Canoe race. <br></p>

                    <p>All Polynesian ethnic groups are known for their
knowledge in sea travel, which was more advanced than that of the Europeans
who discovered French Polynesia. The traditional sport of Va'a uses
traditional outrigger canoes in races between the islands. Modern sports 
include surfing, kitesurfing, and diving. Polynesians are also known for
their exotic dances which were used in various aspects of life, such as
celebration, prayer, and to even challenge an enemy. Today, Polynesian
dancers still dance to traditional thundering drums and conch shells.</p>
