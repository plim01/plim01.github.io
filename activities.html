                    <h1>Beach Walking</h1>
                    <p>French Polynesia is home to many picturesque white sand and pink sand beaches. The beaches are perfect for a walk in the sand with your significant other, or by yourself. Or you can walk slowly and photogenically through the waves as they lap against the shoreline. Make sure to have someone behind you to take a new Facebook profile picture in your scenic surroundings, ideally during one of French Polynesia's beautiful sunsets.</p>

                <div id="section2">
                    <img src="snorkel1.jpg" alt="Snorkeling">
                    <h1>Explore</h1>
                    <p>You can explore French Polynesia on (and in) the crystal clear waters of French Polynesia. Many local companies offer water tours in sailboats or motorized vessels such as jet skis. Some tours also allow you to go snorkeling with and feed the beautiful marine animals that inhabit the waters of the island, or to fish the waters of the island. The island of Moorea offers an amazing Lagoonarium, which is an aquarium in a lagoon- that you can snorkel in and interact with the marine life!<br></p>

                    <p>In addition to the many activities available on the water, there are countless things to do on land. Many companies offer guided hiking and 4x4 safari tours through the mountains and jungles of the islands. You can also explore the beautiful islands of French Polynesia on horseback! There are many guided horseback tours that offer the opportunity to explore the beautiful jungles, waterfalls, beaches and lagoons of the island. You can also explore the ancient marae (temples) that are scattered around the islands or even view old artillery cannons that the U.S. used in WWII.</p>

                    <h1>Go Shopping</h1>
                    <p>Though French Polynesia is rich in natural beauty, it also offers amazing dining and shopping experiences. One can buy artisan wares directly from locals, or from high end stores in the more commercial areas of the islands. Every island also offers high quality fine dining in beautiful locations. </p>

                <div id="section4">
                    <img src="wedding.jpg" alt="Wedding">
                    <h1>Get Married!</h1>
                    <p>The beautiful and intimate islands of French Polynesia are perfect for a wedding. Several wedding resorts throughout the islands offer wedding packages. However, because French Polynesia is such an ideal place for them, one would have to be quite "money-team" to hold a wedding on the islands. Just the flight to <a href="https://www.google.com/flights/#search;f=JFK;t=PPT;q=jfk+to+ppt;d=2016-06-25;r=2016-06-29" target="_blank">French Polynesia from JFK airport</a> is around $2,000 USD (round trip), and the average wedding package prices range from $4,000 to $15,000. Factor in guest accommodations, legal fees, and fireworks cost (the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/borabora/weddings/weddings_at_fourseasons/wedding_packages/poe_here_pearl_of_love/" target="_blank">Four Seasons Resort</a> offers a 2-3 minute firework show) and one would have a heavy price tag for a French Polynesian wedding. However, this money would be very well spent in the most beautiful place on earth.</p>

                <div id="section5">
                    <img src="dolphin.jpg" alt="Dolphins!">
                    <h1>Do Miscellaneous Stuff</h1>
                    <p>There are many opportunities to do other miscellaneous (and usually cheap) activities throughout the islands. You can watch the dazzling and exotic performances of French Polynesian dancers and musicians during festivals and concerts that occur on French Polynesian holidays. You can visit the several institutions of learning such as the Black Pearl Museum, a museum dedicated to pearls (which are an important component of the French Polynesian economy and history) and the Moorea Dolphin Center, a home to 3 protected bottlenose dolphins where people can interact with and learn about the dolphins. Or visit the Polynesian Cultural Center in Tahiti and watch traditional performances by Polynesians. In addition to the man recreational activities in the islands, there are many opportunities to relax in the many spas that are offered in the islands' resorts. Or, you can simply spend time surfing or swimming, eating by the water, or just watching the sun set. </p>
